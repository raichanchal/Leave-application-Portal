# Leave-application-Portal
It was based on a Leave application portal for staff and faculty. They had to take permission from their head and ultimately all application run with tracker that notifies the applicant where his application is at current time. Head can comment on any application and applicant can explain it for proper expalining of leave.
Designed a leave application system for maintaining leave applied by different level of faculty from each department. Each faculty have a separate portfolio to track their records and live comment feature. For the same, a website using PHP for applying for leave and tracking leave application and database management done using SQL in MongoDB.
